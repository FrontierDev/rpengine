# Customisation

This page explains how to customize the UI and palettes, tweak floating combat text behavior, and adjust other profile options.

- Palette and theme: change colors in `UI/Palettes` or via the in-addon palette selector.
- Floating combat text: configured by the `FloatingCombatText` prefab; you can change direction, distance and base scale in the UI initialization code (`Profile/ProfileDB.lua`).
- Shortcuts and hotkeys: see the `UI/Windows` widgets and keybindings sections.
