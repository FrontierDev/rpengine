# Introduction

Welcome to the RPEngine documentation. This site provides user-facing guidance for players and game masters (DMs) running RPE-powered events, plus reference material for customizing and extending the system.

Use the left-hand navigation to get started:

- User Guide — how to play and configure your character and UI.
- DM Guide — tools for datasets, rulesets, and event control.

If you're hosting on Read the Docs, this project is configured to use MkDocs.
