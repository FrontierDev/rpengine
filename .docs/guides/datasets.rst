Datasets
===========

The Item Editor allows DMs to author and manage items used by the ruleset and NPCs.

Fields
------

- `id` - unique key
- `name` - display name
- `icon` - texture file ID or path
- `stats` - stat modifications
- `use` - action or effect when used

Editing
-------
Use the in-game Dataset editor (found in the DM tools) to create and test items. Items are persisted under `Data/` in dataset files.
