Customisation
===========

UI Customisation
----------------
The appearance of the RPEngine interface can be customised using the palettes feature.
To get a list of available palettes, right click on the **minimap button** and select **Palettes**.
Selecting a palette will immediately apply it to the RPEngine interface; no ``/reload`` is necessary.

Most, if not all, RPEngine UI can be dragged around the screen.
The position of these elements is stored *per-character*, so you can have different layouts for different characters if desired.
To reset the position of all RPEngine UI elements to their default positions, use the ``/rpe resetui`` command.

Immersion Mode
----------------
RPEngine features an **Immersion Mode**. 
When enabled, hiding your Blizzard UI will cause the RPEngine UI to still be shown.

You can hide the RPE chat box with the ``/rpe chat`` command, or by clicking the ``X`` button to the left of the chat box itself.

Chat Filtering
----------------
When using the RPE chat box, you may want to filter out certain types of messages.
You can do this by clicking on the buttons underneath the chatbox. 
Hovering over each button will show a tooltip describing what type of messages it filters.
