Loot Distribution
======

Loot can be distributed to players at any time, even outside of an event.
To open the loot distribution window, use the command ``/rpe loot`` or click the minimap button and select **Loot**.

Adding Loot
----------------

Loot can be added by clicking the **Add Loot** button in the loot distribution window.
This will add an empty **loot entry** to the list. 
Right-click on the loot entry to open the context menu, which allows you to select the type of loot to add.
You can add items, currencies, spells or recipes as loot.

Control the quantity of the loot by usin the + and - buttons on the right side of the entry.
Alternatively, right-click the loot entry and select **Set Quantity...** to enter a specific amount.

You can choose to restrict each loot item to a set of specific player by right-clicking the loot entry and selecting **Restrict to...**.
If you want EVERYONE to receive the loot, click the **All Receive Loot** button.

Starting a Loot Roll
----------------

Either press the **Distribute** button at the top of the window or click the dice/bag icon next to a specific loot entry to start a loot roll.
This will open the loot roll window for all players in your group.

There are two types of loot rolls:
- ``NEED BEFORE GREED``: The typical loot roll type where players can choose to roll for need, greed or pass.
- ``BID``: Players can enter a bid amount for the loot item. Each player gets one point per item of loot that is being rolled for.
They can choose to bid any amount of points up to the number of points they have available.

Once their selections have been made, they must press the **Confirm** button to lock in their choice.

Loot Resolution
----------------

When all players have confirmed their choices, or the loot roll timer expires, the loot roll will be resolved automatically.
The player with the highest roll (or highest bid in a BID roll) will be awarded the loot item.
If there is a tie, a re-roll will be initiated between the tied players.
If no players rolled for the loot item, it will remain in the loot distribution window for you to distribute later.
