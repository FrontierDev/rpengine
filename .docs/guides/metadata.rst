Metadata Editor
===============

The Metadata Editor allows you to configure core information about your dataset.

Overview
--------

The metadata section displays and manages the following information:

- **Author**: Creator of the dataset (display-only)
- **Description**: Text describing the dataset's purpose and contents
- **Security Level**: Access control for the dataset (Open, Viewable, or Locked)

Accessing the Metadata Editor
-----------------------------

1. Open the Dataset Editor from the main menu (``/rpe data``)
2. Click the **Metadata** tab
3. The metadata fields will be displayed

Author Information
-------------------

The author field shows who created the dataset. This is automatically set when the dataset is created and cannot be changed.

Editing Description
-------------------

1. In the Description field, enter or edit text describing your dataset
2. Describe what content is included
3. Document any special systems or custom rules
4. Changes are automatically saved

Security Levels
---------------

**Open**
- Anyone can view and edit the dataset
- Best for collaborative, group-created datasets
- No restrictions on modifications

**Viewable**
- Anyone can view the dataset
- Only the author can edit
- Good for published, stable datasets
- Prevents accidental modifications by others

**Locked**
- Only the author can view or edit
- Most restrictive access level
- Use for personal or sensitive datasets
- Non-authors see only read-only displays

Changing Security Level
------------------------

1. Click the **Security Level** dropdown
2. Select the desired level: Open, Viewable, or Locked
3. The change is automatically saved
4. If you lock a dataset you created, others will see read-only displays

Read-Only Mode
---------------

If a dataset is Locked and you are not the author:

- You will see the description and security level displayed as read-only text
- All editing controls are hidden
- You cannot make modifications
- Contact the author if you need to suggest changes

Tips
----

- Use a unique name for your dataset.
- Keep descriptions of your dataset's contents brief.
- Use "Open" for collaborative dataset building.
- Use "Viewable" for datasets you want to share but not allow edits.
- Use "Locked" for personal datasets you don't want others to view.
