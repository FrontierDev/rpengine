Crafting
======

Any recipes that you have learned will be viewable in the **Professions** tab of the **main window**.
You can only view recipes for professions that you have learned through the setup wizard.
Professions cannot currently be learned in any other way.

Crafting works in the same way as in standard WoW. This probably doesn't need explaining any further.

Item Modification
----------------

RPEngine supports item modification - enchants, gems and other augments.
These are largely set up through the item editor.
To add a modification to an item, open the item editor and right-click the item.
Any modifications that you can apply to the item will be shown in the "Modify..." menu.

Trading Items
----------------

You can trade items to other players by right-clicking on the item in your inventory and selecting "Send to...".
Items that have been modified are not tradeable. This is just an engine limitation and may be changed in future.

Currency can also be traded by right-clicking on the currency in your character sheet and selecting "Send to...".
