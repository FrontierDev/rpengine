Unit Control
============

Controls to manipulate a single unit: apply damage/heal, add/remove auras, change initiative and flags.

- Applying damage/heal (local vs broadcast)
- Adding and removing auras
- Adjusting initiative and hidden/active flags

Unit actions map to `Core/Unit.lua` and may be broadcast to players via `Core/Comms`.
