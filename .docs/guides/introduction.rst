Getting Started
============

RPEngine (RPE) is a next-generation roleplay event system addon for World of Warcraft. 
It replaces manual bookkeeping and spreadsheet workflow with an integrated, flexible toolkit for both players and Dungeon Masters. 
RPEngine builds on experience from earlier addons (such as RPToolkit) and focuses on extensibility, clarity, and campaign-friendly features.

Setup Process
----------

The setup process can be summarised in the following steps:

- Activate the correct ruleset for your roll system.
- Activate the required datasets.
- Run ``/rpe setup``.

When you first load RPEngine, you will have three default datasets available: "DefaultClassic", "Default5e", and "DefaultWarcraft". 
At this time, **only DefaultClassic** is fully functional. 
Likewise, you will have access to the "DefaultClassic" ruleset.

Activating Datasets
----------

Type ``/rpe data`` to open the Dataset Manager. Click **edit**, then select the dataset you want to activate. Click the activate button. You can activate multiple datasets.


Activating Rulesets
----------

Type ``/rpe rules`` to open the Ruleset Manager. Click **Load Ruleset** to switch rulesets.


Running Setup
----------

The character setup wizard, ``/rpe setup``, requires a setup wizard to be created in a dataset. 
This will be done by your DM or campaign manager, however, if you want to set one up for yourself, please refer to the dataset-related pages in this guide.
