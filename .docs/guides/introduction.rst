Getting Started
============

RPEngine (RPE) is a next-generation roleplay event system addon for World of Warcraft. 
It replaces manual bookkeeping and spreadsheet workflow with an integrated, flexible toolkit for both players and Dungeon Masters. 
RPEngine builds on experience from earlier addons (such as RPToolkit) and focuses on extensibility, clarity, and campaign-friendly features.

Setup Process
----------

The setup process falls into three parts:

- Activate the correct ruleset for your roll system.
- Activate the required datasets.
- Run ``/rpe setup``.
