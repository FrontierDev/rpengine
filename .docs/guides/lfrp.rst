Looking for RP
===============

The Looking for Roleplay (LFRP) system in RPEngine helps players find others interested in roleplaying. 
It provides a matchmaking interface where players can find players and groups based on their preferences.
To access the LFRP system, type the command ``/rpe lfrp`` in the chat box.

To see other players who are looking for roleplay, press the **Enable LFRP** button.
The text next to the button will change to "Broadcasting...".
This means that your character is now visible to other players using the LFRP system.

By default, the **Broadcast Location** option is disabled.
Enabling this option will share your current in-game location with other players using the LFRP system.
If it is not enabled, you will still be shown in the **Browse** tab, but other players will not see your location.

You can add up to 5 "I am..." tags and 5 "Looking for..." tags to your profile.
These will appear next to your name in the **Browse** tab, helping other players understand what kind of roleplay you are interested in.

Additionally, you can toggle the **Recruitable/Recruiting** option, which indicates whether you are open to being recruited by guilds or if you are looking to recruit others.

The **Approachable** option indicates whether you are open to being approached by other players for roleplay without prior communication.
