Spell Editor
============

The Spell Editor lets DMs author spells with actions and effects.

Key concepts
------------

- Actions map to handlers in `Core/SpellActions.lua` (e.g., `DAMAGE`, `HEAL`).
- Spells include parameters: `amount`, `school`, `critChance`, `perRank` and rank definitions.

Testing
-------
Use the in-game editor to run spell casts in a sandbox or preview mode before saving to production datasets.
